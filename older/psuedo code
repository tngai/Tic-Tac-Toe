- At most 9 loops 
- each loop alternates between Player1 and Player2 
- instantiate the board as objects 
	-The properties of which: box1, box2... box9;x:,y: each with 3 possible values such as "0","x","o"; (x:, y:) are arrays of the box number for possible wins. (if box 1 is marked X then possible wins for X[] is [2,3])
-every time a box is clicked 
	- Need to check if the box is available; 
		if box is not available return text saying "not available"
		if box is available put corresponding "X" or "O" depending on the player. i.e. "X" for odd number of turns "Y" for even 
			-put "X" or "O"
-After the 5th iteration: check for winner a function with if thens connect to box being clicked 

-When a box is clicked a function:
	- Where it first checks to see if the box is available 
	- then if it puts the corresponding "X" or "O"
	- it then needs to check for a winning entry
		



 each box as objects with properties named value:, x:, o:
 	-value = "x","y","o"
 	-x = possible winning combinations for that box i.e box1 => [1,2,3],
